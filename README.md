### Collaborating:

**Never commit directly to the master branch. Create a new branch, and make a merge request to a collaborator.**

### Getting Started:

The Virtual Machine is already configured from ScotchBox, and the Vagrant Box set up to use Laravel's Homestead. To get started:

1. Clone this repo and `cd` into folder
1. In your new directory, run `composer install`
1. Run `vendor/bin/homestead make`
1. Copy the `.env.example` file to a new `.env` file:
`cp .env.example .env`

1. Update password your `.env` file
1. Run `vagrant up`
1. Login to the virtual machine: `vagrant ssh`
1.  Navigate to new `code` folder: `cd code`

Visit `http://homestead.test` on Mac or `http://localhost:8000` on Windows:

### Troubleshooting:

#### Q: When I visit `http://homestead.test` on Mac or `http://localhost:8000` on Windows, I get an Error 500: Internal Server Error
A:

Reload the vagrant box and provision it:

`vagrant reload --provision`


Generate a new app key:

`php artisan key:generate`

#### Q: When I run `vagrant up`, I get the following error:
```
Vagrant was unable to mount VirtualBox shared folders. This is usually
because the filesystem "vboxsf" is not available. This filesystem is
made available via the VirtualBox Guest Additions and kernel module.
Please verify that these guest additions are properly installed in the
guest. This is not a bug in Vagrant and is usually caused by a faulty
Vagrant box. For context, the command attempted was:

mount -t vboxsf -o dmode=777,fmode=666,uid=1000,gid=1000 var_www /var/www

The error output from the command was:

: No such device
```
A:

First, install the `vagrant-vbguest` plugin:

`vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest`


Next, initialise the plugin:

`vagrant vbguest`
